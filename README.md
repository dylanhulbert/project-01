Team Project 01

The objective of this project was to create a responsive webpage utilizing data from API's that we had not previously used in class. We chose to use the NPS (National Park Service) API and the Weather API. Using the data collected from the response, we chose to display to the user the park hours, directions, five day forecast, and two images of each of the parks upon selection from the dropdown. 

This project required extensive work with multiple web API's, jQuery, JavaScript, and utilizing the Chrome Developer tools for styling and debugging. This project also required learning a new framework, Semantic UI. 

Another newly developed skill is that as a team, we got a lot of practice utilizing GitHub branches.
